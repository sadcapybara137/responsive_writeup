<h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p>
        Bagel Gourmet is a popular restaurant chain local to Providence which serves
        breakfast sandwiches. I have gone there often myself, and consequently
        experienced viewing their webpage. The webpage features
        information about one of their restaurants, including its location, menu, and a
        contact page. While exploring their webpage deeper, I found some "secret" options
        in their menu. For example, clicking "menu" in the top bar brings you to the menu page,
        which on the sidebar has a "shopping cart" option for placing online orders. I would
        have not known this option existed otherwise. <b> I decided I will try to redesign their
        main webpage because some of its features are hidden and the layout can be improved,
        also because I like sandwiches. </b>

<h1> Webpage Problems </h1>
    <p> I will start by creating a list of the issues I have with Bagel Gourmet's website
    so I can address them in my redesign. </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="list_header"> Efficiency
            <ul class="list_sub">
                <li> The "photos" page, linked in the top menu has only four photos which could
                be integrated into the main page. By doing so, users don't have to use the navigation
                menu to look at pictures. </li>
                <li> One user goal for viewing the website may be finding restaurant hours. The
                restaurant hours are listed on a small sidebar and have a lot of words directly above
                them. Putting the hours in a spot which is easily viewable and not cluttered would
                improve efficiency. </li>
                <li> The main navigation bar on the top of the webpage is not easily noticeable
                    on the screen. It is not centered and the text in it is small. Users may lose
                time looking for the menu as a result. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="list_header"> Learnability
            <ul class="list_sub">
                <li> While navigating between pages, the navigation bar changes position,
                requiring users to learn two different layouts. </li>
                <li> Some of the text in their description is underlined but isn't a link,
                which goes against current conventions. Users would have to learn that the
                underlined text for this specific page isn't always a link. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="list_header"> Memorability
            <ul class="list_sub">
                <li> Not all website functions are listed on the main page. This requires users
                to navigate between different pages and the order of their navigation. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="list_header"> Accessibility
            <ul class="list_sub">
                <li> I uploaded the website to WebAIM Wave to look at its accessibility. WebAIM
                Wave has issues loading the page visually.</li>
                <li> A fairly obvious accessibility issue with the page was a lack of alt text on images.
                Alt text is what a screen reader reads to a user when they encounter a media element. Due to
                this, blind users would not know what images they are viewing on the page. </li>
                <li> Some low-contrast errors I was able to ignore. For example, the line "THE BEST
                BAGELS IN RHODE ISLAND!!" is split between multiple span elements. Since they are
                close to each other, and the text is the same color, there is a contrast error. However,
                it makes sense for this single line of text to be the same color. </li>
                <li> One low-contrast error I agreed with was with the navigation bar on the bottom
                of the page. Parts of the text in the bar blends in with the background while viewed
                in grayscale:</li>
                <img src="bagel_gourmet_contrast.png", alt="A picture of the Bagel Gourmet website featuring
                text in greyscale and a similar gray background with low constrast." style="width:30%;">
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="list_header"> Other Miscellaneous Issues </li>
            <ul class="list_sub">
                <li> The main page has overlapping images, there are delivery hours featured on
                the page, but not store hours. There is not a clear hierarchy of font colors and
                sizes. </li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="block3">
<h1> Wireframes </h1>
<p>
    Now that I have identified problems with Bagel Gourmet's website, I created 3 wireframes
    to address these issues -- one for laptops, one for tablets, and one for phones.
</p>

<div class="wireframes">
    <img src="wireframe_laptop.png"
         alt = "Picture of annotated wireframe for laptop" style="width:70%; border:5px solid;">
    Wireframe for laptop webpage. <br><br>
    <img src="wireframe_tablet.png" alt = "Picture of annotated wireframe for tablet" style="width:70%; border:5px solid;">
    Wireframe for tablet webpage. <br><br>
    <img src="wireframe_phone.png" alt = "Picture of annotated wireframe for phone" style="width:70%; border:5px solid;">
    Wireframe for phone webpage. <br><br>
</div>
</div>
<div class="block4">
<h1> Style Guide </h1>
<p>
    Given the designs I would like to create with my wireframe prototypes, I created a style guide to
    outline how I will create the different components of the webpage. While designing the style guide,
    I tried to keep the color scheme of the webpage as close to Bagel Gourmet's as possible.
</p>
<div class="wireframes">
    <img src="style_guide.png" alt="An image of the style guide outlining core elements of the webpage.">
</div>

<h1> High Fidelity Prototypes </h1>
<p>
    After deciding how I wanted to style the new Bagel Gourmet website, I created prototypes of the
    page in Figma based off of my wireframes.
</p>
<div class="wireframes">
    <img src="hifi_laptop.png"
         alt = "Picture of annotated high-fidelity prototype for laptop" style="width:70%; border:5px solid;">
    High-fidelity prototype for laptop webpage. <br><br>
    <img src="hifi_tablet.png" alt = "Picture of annotated high-fidelity prototype for tablet" style="width:70%; border:5px solid;">
    High-fidelity prototype for tablet webpage. <br><br>
    <img src="hifi_phone.png" alt = "Picture of annotated high-fidelity prototype for phone" style="width:70%; border:5px solid;">
    High-fidelity prototype for phone webpage. <br><br>
